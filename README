This project was part of my Human Centred Coputing course at Clemson University. It was team project.

The application that we came up with is a web-app which filters out good news from the bad ones
and project only the good ones. We implemented Sentiment Analysis algorithm which is basically a
pattern recognition algorithm that classifies a piece of news article into good or bad depending
upon the words that are used in that article. For a more in-depth discussion please visit

We used HTML, JavaScript, AJAX and PHP for implementing different modules of this application
